    This is the Beardog Minimal version, allowing 
    the user to install their own packages.  For a 
    complete setup install the Lilidog full version.

    If you would like to customize your setup by
    answering a few questions, press the 'Begin'
    button below. Use 'sudo xentry -i' in order to
    try out the customization script later.
